### Features

1. Video Search: Search for videos by title or video ID

2. Video Player: Play videos by video ID or title

3. Video List: Muzak fetches up to 5 videos from YouTube and displays them in a list alongside the main video player

4. Video ID Logs to Console: Due to time constraints, Muzak only logs video ID's to the console at this point in time. To view the video ID's, open the console and click on a video from the list.
